  Hello everyone👋
  </p>
  <p>
    My name is Richael, a senior at <a href="https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/">Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University</a>  majoring in Information and Computing Science. 
    I have found immense joy in exploring the fields of machine learning and deep learning through various challenging projects, both as an independent researcher and a collaborative team member. My research journey has primarily been rooted in the fascinating intersection of audio processing🎶 and artificial intelligence, and I am proud to have been part of a team that published work at wonderful audio-focused conferences, including ISMIR, CMMR, and the DCASE Workshop🤩. 
    My curiosity also led me to the realm of computer vision👁️, where I investigated how fusing infrared and visible light could enhance task performance. 
    These hands-on research experiences have been incredibly fulfilling and have cemented my aspiration to continue exploring these advanced topics at the graduate level.

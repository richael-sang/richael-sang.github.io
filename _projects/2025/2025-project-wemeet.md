 This junior-year software engineering course project involved the complete development lifecycle of "WeMeet," an enterprise-grade meeting room booking system using Spring Boot 3.4 (Java 17), MySQL, and Spring Security.

The system features a dual-portal design for both users and administrators, providing functionalities like advanced room filtering, real-time booking management, user access control, and analytics dashboards.

I designed the relational database schema, containerized the application with Docker, and deployed it to Alibaba Cloud, implementing a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment. This project showcases end-to-end full-stack development and DevOps capabilities.

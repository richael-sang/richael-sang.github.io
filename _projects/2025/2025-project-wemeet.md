  This junior-year software engineering course project involved the complete development lifecycle of an enterprise-grade meeting room booking system called WeMeet. The project encompasses requirements analysis, system design, implementation, testing, and deployment using modern software engineering practices.


  System Architecture & Technology Stack – Built with Spring Boot 3.4 framework using Java 17, MySQL database with JPA for data persistence, Spring Security for authentication and authorization, Thymeleaf for server-side rendering, and Redis for caching. The system follows the MVC architectural pattern with a clear separation of concerns across controllers, services, repositories, and DTOs.


  Dual-Portal Design – Implemented comprehensive functionality for both end-users and administrators. The user portal includes meeting room browsing with advanced filtering, real-time booking management, personal profile customization, and notification system. The administrator portal provides user management, room inventory control, booking oversight, audit logging, and statistical dashboards.


  Product Backlog Items (PBIs) – Successfully implemented multiple user stories covering authentication flows (login, registration, password recovery), room management (CRUD operations with image uploads, capacity and equipment tracking), booking workflows (conflict detection, approval system, cancellation handling), notification system (email integration, in-app alerts), and administrative analytics (booking trends, room utilization, user activity reports).


  Database Design & Integration – Designed a normalized relational database schema with entities for users, meeting rooms, bookings, notifications, and audit logs. Implemented complex SQL queries for filtering, searching, and aggregating data across multiple tables with proper indexing for performance optimization.


  Deployment & DevOps – Containerized the application using Docker for consistent deployment across environments. Successfully deployed to Alibaba Cloud with proper configuration management for production, staging, and development environments. Implemented CI/CD practices for automated testing and deployment.


  Testing & Quality Assurance – Developed comprehensive unit tests and integration tests to ensure system reliability. Performed user acceptance testing with real-world scenarios and stress testing for concurrent bookings.


  This project demonstrates proficiency in full-stack Java development, database design, RESTful API development, security implementation, and cloud deployment, showcasing end-to-end software engineering capabilities.

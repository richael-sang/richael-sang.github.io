  This junior-year software engineering course project involved the complete development lifecycle of "WeMeet," an enterprise-grade meeting room booking system. Built with a modern Java stack including Spring Boot 3.4 (Java 17), MySQL, and Spring Security, the system follows an MVC architectural pattern with a clear Service-Repository design. It features a dual-portal design providing comprehensive functionality for both end-users and administrators, including advanced room filtering, real-time booking management with conflict detection, a notification system, and role-based access control.

  I designed the normalized relational database schema, defining key entities and relationships to ensure data integrity. For deployment, the application was containerized using Docker for environmental consistency and deployed to Alibaba Cloud. A CI/CD pipeline was also implemented to automate building, testing, and deployment, enabling rapid and reliable updates. This project showcases end-to-end full-stack development, from system architecture and database design to cloud deployment and DevOps practices.

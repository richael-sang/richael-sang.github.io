  This project was part of a junior-year HCI course focused on conceptual design. Our team designed an app that leverages generative AI to create personalized travel itineraries. The app was prototyped entirely in Figma, including interactive mockups to simulate user flows and AI-generated content.


  The project included two phases: a team project, presented through a written report and an interactive demo, and an individual project, where I independently iterated on our team’s design, introducing new features and improvements. I developed a personal design portfolio and recorded a demo with voice narration to present the final concept.

  This computer graphics project brings a real-world campus scene to life in 3D, recreating a lakeside building environment with meticulous attention to architectural details, natural elements, and atmospheric effects. Using C++ and OpenGL, I transformed photographs of an actual location into a fully navigable 3D virtual space.


  The scene features a multi-story academic building with textured stone walls, wooden architectural details, and realistic windows overlooking a serene lake. Natural elements include a grassy landscape, an animated water surface, and dynamic clouds drifting across a skybox that wraps around the entire environment. The reconstruction captures both the structural essence and the peaceful ambiance of the original location.


  A 360-degree orbiting camera system allows viewers to explore the scene from any angle, revealing architectural details from ground level to rooftop. The camera smoothly rotates around a fixed reference point, providing cinematic views of the building's relationship with its natural surroundings. Users can control the camera's horizontal and vertical rotation to discover different perspectives and appreciate how light and shadow interact with the architecture.


  The project demonstrates the translation of real-world observation into digital geometry, combining technical graphics programming with artistic interpretation to create an immersive virtual environment that preserves the character and atmosphere of the original space.

 This computer graphics project recreates a real-world campus lakeside building in 3D using C++ and OpenGL. By transforming photographs into a navigable virtual space, the scene features a detailed academic building with textures, an animated water surface, and a dynamic skybox.

A 360-degree orbiting camera system allows users to explore the scene from any angle, revealing architectural details and the interaction of light and shadow. The project combines technical graphics programming with artistic interpretation to create an immersive virtual environment.

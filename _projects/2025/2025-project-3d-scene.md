  This computer graphics project recreates a real-world Suzhou Dushu Lake Church in 3D using C++ and OpenGL. By transforming photographs into a navigable virtual space, the scene's geometry was constructed from the ground up using OpenGL primitives. Realism was achieved through meticulous texture mapping and a basic lighting model that creates believable light and shadow interactions.

  The environment includes natural elements like an animated water surface, simulated by manipulating vertex heights with sine waves, and a dynamic skybox for an immersive backdrop. A 360-degree orbiting camera system, controlled by user input, allows for smooth exploration from any angle, revealing architectural details from ground level to rooftop. This project combines technical graphics programming with artistic interpretation to translate a physical space into an interactive and atmospheric virtual environment.

  This networking project implements a secure file transfer system from scratch using Python socket programming. The application follows a custom-designed communication protocol (STEP), which defines command structures, status responses, and how JSON metadata is transmitted alongside the binary file stream. The system features a multi-threaded Tkinter GUI client that remains responsive and does not freeze during lengthy network operations.

  The client provides an intuitive interface for user authentication, file management, and real-time progress tracking for large file transfers. Security is a core component, incorporating hashed passwords, token-based sessions for persistent login, and MD5 checksums to verify file integrity after transit. This project showcases low-level network programming, from designing a complete protocol specification to implementing robust error handling for various network failure scenarios.

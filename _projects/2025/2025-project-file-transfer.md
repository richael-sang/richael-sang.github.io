  This networking project implements a secure file transfer system from scratch using Python socket programming and a custom-designed communication protocol (STEP).

  The system features a Tkinter GUI client for user authentication, file management, and real-time progress tracking for large file transfers. Security is a core component, with hashed passwords, token-based sessions, and MD5 checksums for file integrity. This project showcases low-level network programming, protocol design, and multi-threading for a responsive UI.

 This sophomore-year Java project visualizes hierarchical flow data using Sankey diagrams. The application reads structured text files and uses a custom JavaFX GUI to render interactive diagrams with custom components like rectangles, labels, and flow paths. Key features include data parsing, an interactive interface, and event handling for UI customization, showcasing fundamental skills in Java OOP and GUI development.

  This senior-year project for an Advanced Java course was divided into two main parts:

  Sorting Algorithm Benchmarking – We implemented and compared the performance of several classic sorting algorithms, presenting the results in a structured table with efficiency metrics under different input conditions.

  U.S. Road Trip Route Optimization – I independently designed and implemented this part, developing a route planning system to compute the shortest path for a road trip across U.S. cities. The system compared different algorithms and strategies, including Dijkstra’s Algorithm, variations of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), and hybrid approaches. The project also included visualizations to demonstrate how each algorithm computed and optimized routes.

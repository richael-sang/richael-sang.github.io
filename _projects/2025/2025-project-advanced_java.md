  This comprehensive Java project explores algorithm efficiency and intelligent route planning through two interconnected components that demonstrate advanced programming techniques and problem-solving capabilities.


  The first component benchmarks classic sorting algorithms—comparing QuickSort, MergeSort, HeapSort, and others across various data conditions. Performance metrics are presented in structured tables, revealing how algorithm choices impact real-world application performance. This analysis provides practical insights into computational complexity beyond theoretical Big-O notation.


  The second component tackles the fascinating challenge of planning optimal road trips across U.S. cities. I independently designed and implemented this routing system, which compares multiple pathfinding strategies: Dijkstra's Algorithm for guaranteed shortest paths, variations of the Traveling Salesman Problem for visiting multiple cities efficiently, and hybrid approaches that balance computation time with route quality.


  What makes this project compelling is the interactive visualization system that brings algorithms to life. Watch as Dijkstra's algorithm explores the road network, see how TSP heuristics make trade-offs between optimality and speed, and compare how different strategies navigate the same cross-country journey. The visualizations transform abstract algorithmic concepts into intuitive, visual problem-solving processes.


  Beyond implementing textbook algorithms, this project required creative problem-solving: designing efficient data structures for road networks, optimizing algorithm performance for real-time interaction, and creating clear visualizations that reveal algorithmic behavior. The result is both an educational tool that demystifies pathfinding algorithms and a practical system for planning actual road trips with quantifiable route comparisons.

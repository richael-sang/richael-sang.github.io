  This junior-year computer graphics project is an interactive 2D animated birthday card built with C++ and OpenGL. It demonstrates 2D transformations, animation techniques, and user interaction.

  The card features a two-page design with a cover and inner page, brought to life with multiple simultaneous animations like breathing stars, a rotating candle, and a smooth page-sliding transition. Interactive features, including keyboard controls and click-triggered physics-based effects, showcase proficiency in low-level graphics programming and animation principles.
